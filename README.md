This is a page that takes in your family makeup and occupation(s), and tells you where you're least likely to get behind financially.  It relies on data from the [Living Wage Calculator](http://livingwage.mit.edu/): a site that provides cost of living estimates for about 3,600 locations across the U.S.  These estimates take the following expenses into account: food, child care, medical care, housing, transportation, and taxes.  The site also contains typical salaries for various occupations, for each location.  My page queries this information and looks for locations where family income minus the cost of living is maximized. The code I used to scrape the site is in the populate_database folder.
